This project serves as a strong foundation for a full-stack application, demonstrating core frontend development skills.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Data Display:** Renders a list of popular cryptocurrencies with their price and change percentage.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to filter the list to quickly find a specific cryptocurrency by name or symbol.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Sleek UI:** Utilizes a dark mode theme for a professional and modern aesthetic.
- **Placeholder Data:** Currently uses hardcoded data to simulate an API response, demonstrating the UI/UX logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the page structure and content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design (using Flexbox/Grid).
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic, dynamic rendering, and search functionality.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap: From Frontend to Full-Stack

This project is planned to evolve into a full-stack application with the following future features:
